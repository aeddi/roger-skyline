After redump & redeploy:
V sendmail (daemon from purge exim4*) using :25, :587 => kill anything using those ports
V :25 transport denied -> forgot to list /etc/postfix/main.cf in dump list
- :587 cannot connect saslauthd: "Permission denied" => deja vu
? systemd holding :993 (POP3) (should yield to dovecot whenever conn:993 inbound)
X!(UNTRUE-CLEANUP) Ansible does not compare file contents. Nuke any existing config !
